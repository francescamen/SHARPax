# SHARPax

Algorithms for human activity recognition with a commercial IEEE 802.11ax router @ 5 GHz, 80 MHz of bandwidth.

This repository contains the reference code for the article [''Towards Integrated Sensing and Communications in IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi Networks''](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13930). The algorithms are an adaptation to the case of 802.11ax devices of the original [''SHARP algorithm''](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9804861).

## NOTE: The article [meneghello2023toward] is currently under peer review. The code and the dataset will be available after the article pubblication.

The dataset that will be made available contains Wi-Fi channel frequency response (CFR) data collected in an IEEE 802.11ax network through [AX CSI](https://ans.unibs.it/projects/ax-csi/).
